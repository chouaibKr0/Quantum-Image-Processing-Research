This report provides a comprehensive review of quantum clustering techniques applied to image segmentation. We explore the fundamental principles of quantum computing, examine how quantum algorithms can enhance traditional clustering methods, and discuss their application to the challenging task of image segmentation. The review covers both theoretical foundations and practical implementations, highlighting the potential advantages of quantum approaches over classical methods.
